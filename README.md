# Weather_API
Pulls weather from 3rd Party API. Searchable by city and shows the 5 day forecast for that specific city.

### Introduction:
This is my attempt at creating a dynamic webpage involving 3rd party API's. It pulls data from a remote server, which allows users to search for a specific city. This utilizes several ajax protocols, as well as basic JQuery and javascript elements. 

### Here is the final product:
